# Journal

This project is a rework of the current flow for constant journalling I currently use Notion for. The plan is to incorporate all of the features I use already and improve upon them.

## Requirements

- Should be markdown writing style just like Notion
- Should auto open on today's date with the template setup
- New entries to a day should be default
    - with timestamp
    - with current location
- Should allow for future reminders to be set
    - Would be cool if it notified me via text at a given time
- Should have pages setup for each Github project I have
    - Setup automatically
- No need to timestamp my comments
- Current weather display
- Easy access to the file upload store
- Search ability over notes
- Public version so people (Kate) can see my schedule
- Git hook which adds a commit block in the day entry
- A link can be an entry
